## To-do

**Finish by Tuesday:**

*Marc*:

- Bibtex bibliography (Macos, use for example Bibdesk): 
    - add references from lit review

    1. Download [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/)
    2. Open [bib.bib](bib.bib)
    3. Inside any of our markdown (.Rmd) documents, use citation key to cite, for example: \@pfaff2008var will turn into @pfaff2008var. If you want brackets around it, the write [\@pfaff2008var] which will look as follows [@pfaff2008var].
    
*Ignacio*:

- Get UK data (*)
- Double-check US data (CPI now poorly defined, interest rate?)
    - update the preprocessing for this [preprocessing.Rmd](preprocessing.Rmd)

*Pat*:

- Polish the package functionality 

**Rest of the week:**

- Use code for model comparison: VAR, MLSTM (preferred VAR-type), MLSTM (timestamps for lags)
    - compare insample MSE, cumulative loss (Pat to add functionality) 
    - Diebold Mariano
    - provide anecdotal evidence of where/when the MLSTM performs better:
        - train-test split
          1. train-test split the pre-covid data
          2. train on pre-covide, test on post-covid
        - out-of-sample forecasts - covid (*) 
- Section on interpretability and other approaches (links to NAVAR and Verstyuk)
    - Show IRFs, FEVD, etc. from SVAR, talk to the intuition and highlight shortfalls of deep learning approach also linking to NAVAR and Verstyuk.
    - Impulse response function (*)

**By end of week have a draft ready!!!**

2. Introduction:
    - What?
    - Theoretical framework: VAR vs. NAVAR?
    - Empirical approach
3. Methodology 
    - VAR
    - NAVAR
4. Data
5. Benchmark exercises
    - Point, interval and density forecasts
    - Granger causality
    - IRFs
    - Forecasting evaluation: DM, forecasting combination
6. Extensions
    - Forward guidance?
