# navar

## Structure/To-do

- Bibtex bibliography (Macos, use for example Bibdesk)
-   Go through NAVAR code and reproduce experiments:
    <https://github.com/bartbussmann/NAVAR>
        - I have added that code as a folder to this repo. Code looks straight-forward, but should all spend some time going through it to really understand what is going on.
        
1. Literature review:
    - Literature on forecasting time series
    - Literature on high-dimensinoal data: BoE paper(s); ECB? 
    - Monetary transmission mechanism: VAR, BVAR, SVAR
    - Check "Related work" section in @bussmann2020neural
    - Neural networks for time series forecasting
2. Introduction:
    - What?
    - Theoretical framework: VAR vs. NAVAR?
    - Empirical approach
3. Methodology 
    - VAR
    - NAVAR
4. Data
5. Benchmark exercises
    - Point, interval and density forecasts
    - Granger causality
    - IRFs
    - Forecasting evaluation: DM, forecasting combination
6. Extensions
    - Forward guidance?
    - QE?
7. Conclusions
