# navar

## To-do

- Bibtex bibliography (Macos, use for example Bibdesk)
-   Go through NAVAR code and reproduce experiments:
    <https://github.com/bartbussmann/NAVAR>
        - I have added that code as a folder to this repo. Code looks straight-forward, but should all spend some time going through it to really understand what is going on.
        - CHECK: is the training function really well set up?
