abstract: "Vector autoregression (VAR) models have been the traditional technique in the last decades when it comes to the forecasting of time series data. In particular, the VAR framework has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series, hence becoming a useful tool for policy makers, whcih rely on this methodology to construct forecasts or even for the analysis of impulse response functions. However, with the recent advancement in computational power of computers, and more importantly, the development of more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to analyze and forecast time series data. This paper aims to contribute to the time series literature by introducing a ground-breaking methodology which we name Deep Vector Autoregression (Deep VAR). By fitting each equation of the VAR system with a neural network, the Deep VAR outperfroms the VAR in terms of in-sample fit, out-of-sample fit and point forecasting accuracy. In particular, the Deep VAR is able to better capture the patterns in recession times. "
