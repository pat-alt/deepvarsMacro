## Structure/To-do

1.  

-   Bibtex bibliography (Macos, use for example Bibdesk)
-   Go through NAVAR code and reproduce experiments:
    <https://github.com/bartbussmann/NAVAR>
        - I have added that code as a folder to this repo. Code looks straight-forward, but should all spend some time going through it to really understand what is going on.

1.  Literature review:
    -   Literature on forecasting time series
    -   Literature on high-dimensinoal data: BoE paper(s); ECB?
    -   Monetary transmission mechanism: VAR, BVAR, SVAR
    -   Check “Related work” section in Bussmann, Nys, and Latré (2020)
    -   Neural networks for time series forecasting
2.  Introduction:
    -   What?
    -   Theoretical framework: VAR vs. NAVAR?
    -   Empirical approach
3.  Methodology
    -   VAR
    -   NAVAR
4.  Data
5.  Benchmark exercises
    -   Point, interval and density forecasts
    -   Granger causality
    -   IRFs
    -   Forecasting evaluation: DM, forecasting combination
6.  Extensions
    -   Forward guidance?
    -   QE?
7.  Conclusions
