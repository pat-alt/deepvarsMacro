# Literature review {#lit-review}

There is broad agreement among economists on the fact that monetary policy affects economic activity in the short and medium term. @friedman2008monetary found that monetary policy actions are followed by movements in real output that may last for two years or more (@romer1989does; @bernanke1990federal). The underlying forces that trigger these outcomes is of great interest to most economists. Central bankers in particular aim to understand the monetary transmission mechanism. If monetary policy affects the real economy, then what exactly is the transmission mechanism through which these effects occur? This is one of the questions which is among the most important and controversial topics in modern-day macroeconomics.

In the aftermath of the oil price shock in the 1970's, interest emerged in understanding business cycles. To this end economists initially made use of large-scale macroeconomic models, which was criticized by @lucas1976econometric, stating that the assumption of invariant behavioural equations was inconsistent with dynamic maximizing behaviour. Hence, **New Classical** economists started to make use of so-called market clearing models of economic fluctuations. With the goal of really taking into account productivity shocks, **Real Business Cycle** models were developed (@kydland1982time).

Following the failure of large-scale macroeconomic models when trying to predict business cycles, the economic profession resorted to structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models to analyse business cycles, which proved to be useful for capturing the impact of policy actions. @sims1986forecasting suggested that VARs were an efficient tool to evaluate macroeconomic models. One of the advantages of VARs is their simplicity, which makes it easy to estimate and interpret them.

Yet, this simplicity comes are a cost: conventional VARs are typically not able to capture non-linear relationships in the data, which might be significant a limitation. In the case of economic time series that form part of the monetary transmission mechanism, specifically output, inflation, interest rates and labour market variable, non-linear dependencies are likely to be form part of the data generating process as shown by @brock1991nonlinear. This is true in particular during times of abrupt and significant economic fluctuations.

During past years, economists have therefore started to non-linear techniques to their forecasting toolkit. Machine Learning has contributed a lot to this field of research. Some of the most popular machine learning techniques which do not assume a linear relationship between inputs and outputs include K-Nearest Neighbors (first introduced by @fix1951important), Support Vector Machines (mostly developed by @cortes1995support), Random Forests (first introduced in 1995 by @ho1995random) and Deep Artificial Neural Networks (first proposed in 1943 by @mcculloch1990logical). The latter have been explored previously in the realm of time series forecasting (@hamzaccebi2008improving, @zhang2003time, @kihoro2004seasonal). Neural networks are non-parametric models and have been shown to be particularly successful at capturing non-linearities (@zhang1998forecasting, @zhang2003time).

A particular subclass of neural networks used primarily for sequential data are recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs propagate previous outputs recursively allows the model to learn persistent dependencies and thereby making them very efficient for time series data [@dorffner1996neural].

For this reason, a lot of authors interested in forecasting economic time series have compared linear models with nonlinear models. In economic time series, in the short run, the time series is expected to behave more or less the same way it has been behaving up to this point, but on the other hand, if we are interested in forecasting at a big window, then is when chaos and instability appear, meaning that nonlinear relations may arise, making it more appealing to use ANN as they are capable of identifying these turning points as they do not assume a linear relationship of inputs and outputs.

This was shown by a recent paper of the Bank of England, @joseph2021forecasting. In this paper they run a horse race for forecasting inflation among different horizons comparing the performance of linear and nonlinear algorithms. The results support our hypothesis that NN and other nonlinear Machine Learning algorithms are useful for forecasting at a longer horizon given that, the longer the horizon, the more likely it is to find the chaos and instability @brock1991nonlinear talked about. And, as previously exposed, these turning points are hard to spot with linear relationships of inputs and outputs, while they might be easier to spot with nonlinear models, like SVM or NN.

One of the problems of RNN is the long-term dependency. To illustrate it with an example, some decisions are made taking into account information that happened way back in the past. RNN struggle to keep this very old information threfore limiting its forecasting power. In order to solve this problem,  @hochreiter1997long introduced the LSTM in the paper Long Short-Term Memory. This is the reason why a lot of authors use this type of RNN when forecasting any kind of time series.
